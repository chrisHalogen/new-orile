        <h1>Safety Promise</h1>
        <p>
          The restaurant industry has an outstanding track record of protecting
          our employees and guests. To ensure everyone's safety as we welcome
          you back into our dining rooms, we ask that we make the following
          promises to each other:
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>Our promise to you</span>
          <br />
          We will continue to be a leader in safe sanitation practices with all
          team members trained in safe food handling and a certified manager on
          every shift.
          <br />
          All employees will pass a health check prior to each shift.
          <br />
          All indoor and outdoor seating options will comply with the
          appropriate social distancing guidelines.
          <br />
          Hand sanitizer or hand washing stations will be available to all
          guests and employees.
          <br />
          We will clean and sanitize common areas and surfaces regularly.
          <br />
          We will clean and sanitize each dining area after every use.
          <br />
          Place settings, utensils, menus, and condiments will either be
          single-use or will be cleaned and sanitized after every use.
          <br />
          We will post the Orile Promise at our entrances so everyone
          understands the steps we must all take to keep our communities safe.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>Your promise to us</span>
          <br />

          to assist you.
